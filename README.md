# Fruits-360: 3-body problem #

## Version: 2025.04.21.0 ##

A 3-class (Apples, Cherries and Tomatoes) classification problem.

Train on some (varieties of) fruits and vegetables and test on other (varieties of) fruits and vegetables.

Training and Test folders contain different varieties of fruits and vegetables. 
This is different from the classic Fruits-360 dataset where pictures of the same fruit were in both Training and Test folders!

## Dataset properties ##

Total number of images: 47033.

Training set size: 34800 images.

Test set size: 12233 images.

Number of classes: 3 (Apples, Cherries, Tomatoes).

Number of varieties: Apples = 29; Cherries = 12; Tomatoes = 19.

Image size: 100x100 pixels.

## Filename format ##

image_index_100.jpg (e.g. 31_100.jpg) or 

r_image_index_100.jpg (e.g. r_31_100.jpg) or 

r?_image_index_100.jpg (e.g. r2_31_100.jpg)

where "r" stands for rotated fruit. "r2" means that the fruit was rotated around the 3rd axis. 
"100" comes from image size (100x100 pixels).

## Repository structure ##

Folders [Training](Training) and [Test](Test) contain images for training and testing purposes.
